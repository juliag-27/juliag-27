## Hi, I'm Julia! :wave:
<h1> About me </h1>
I'm a student at Brown University looking to learn more about AI, machine learning, and data science. I'm a strong advocate of growth mindsets, leveraging opportunities, and creative thinking. Feel free to ask me about my current developments as a Break Through Tech fellow! Outside of classes, I'm excited about research in cognitive neuroscience, LLM projects, and doing pottery with the Pottery @ Brown leadership team. My pronouns are she/her. :)

<h2> Tech Stack :desktop_computer: </h2>

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,java,cpp,html,css,pytorch,sklearn,matlab,vscode,bash,docker,github,idea)](https://skillicons.dev)


<h2> Projects :seedling: </h2>
<h3> Energy Efficiency of Buildings through Open Source Data </h3>
Summary: Used novel architecture with open-source Google API data to classify buildings as energy-efficient or inefficient according to the EPC Registry. Tools used: Python, Pandas, GCP, Pytorch, DataLoader, Tqdm, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

<h3> RedditBias: Problematic Comment Detector </h3>
Summary: Preprocessed and vectorized 7,000+ examples of labelled text with Pandas Dataframes and Huggingface's BERT tokenizer, trained a BERT large language model to classify sentences with bias (racial, sexual orientation-wise, gender-wise, religious-wise). Tools used: Python, Pandas, Pytorch, Huggingface Transformers and Datasets libraries, DataLoader library, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

<h3> World Happiness Report 2018: Lifespan Analysis </h3>
Summary: Trained scikit-learn's Decision Tree and Linear Regressor models to predict the life expectancy of country populations with subjective features such as Life Ladder (1-10, how "satisfied" an individual is with their life), trust in government, and freedom. Viewed model weights to identify Life Ladder to correlate most with lifespan, just under a country's GDP. Tools used: Jupyter, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

<h3> Agents </h3>
Summary: Initialized a population of Agents with exchanging energy mechanisms to model the complexity of community interactions. Studied key practices in object-oriented programming in Python.
