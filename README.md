## Hi, I'm Julia! :wave:
I'm a student at Brown University looking to learn more about AI, machine learning, and data science. I'm a strong advocate of growth mindsets, leveraging opportunities, and creative thinking. Outside of computational work, I'm excited about research in cognitive neuroscience, LLMs, and doing pottery with the Pottery @ Brown leadership team. My pronouns are she/her. :)

<h2> Tech Stack :desktop_computer: </h2>

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,java,cpp,html,css,pytorch,sklearn,matlab,vscode,bash,docker,github,idea)](https://skillicons.dev)


<h2> Projects :seedling: </h2>
<h3> Energy Efficiency of Buildings through Open Source Data </h3>
Implemented novel architecture with ~35,000 images extracted from open-source Google API to classify buildings as energy-efficient or inefficient according to the EPC Registry. Tools used: Python, Pandas, GCP, Pytorch, DataLoader, Tqdm, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

<h3> Women's ADHD Diagnoses </h3>
Predicted ADHD diagnosis and female/not female with functional connectivity matrices at 91% training accuracy using 1,213 fMRI data scans. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pytorch Geometric, Scikit-learn, Google Colab

<h3> RedditBias: Problematic Comment Detector </h3>
Preprocessed and vectorized 7,000+ labeled texts and trained a BERT large language model to classify sentences with racial, orientation, gender, or religious bias. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Pytorch, Huggingface Transformers and Datasets libraries, DataLoader library, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

<h3> World Happiness Report 2018: Lifespan Analysis </h3>
Predict the life expectancy of country populations with subjective (not objective!) life factors. Tools used: Jupyter, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

<h3> Agents </h3>
Initialized a population of Agents with exchanging energy mechanisms to model the complexity of community interactions. Studied key practices in object-oriented programming in Python.
