## Hi, I'm Julia! :wave:
<h1> About me </h1>
I'm a student at Brown University looking to learn more about AI, machine learning, and data science. I'm an advocate for growth mindsets, leveraging opportunities, and creative thinking. Feel free to ask me about my current developments as a Break Through Tech fellow! Outside of classes, I'm excited about my research in cognitive neuroscience, LLM projects, and doing pottery with the Pottery @ Brown leadership team. My pronouns are she/her.

<h2> Projects :seedling: </h2>
<h3> RedditBias: LLM Classification of Problematic Speech </h3>
**(IN PROGRESS) **
Summary: Preprocessed and vectorized 7,000+ examples of labelled text with Pandas Dataframes and Huggingface's BERT tokenizer, trained a BERT large language model to classify sentences with bias (racial, sexual orientation-wise, gender-wise, religious-wise). Tools used: Python, Pandas, Pytorch, Huggingface Transformers and Datasets libraries, DataLoader library, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

<h3> World Happiness Report 2018: Lifespan Analysis </h3>
Summary: Trained scikit-learn's Decision Tree and Linear Regressor models to predict the life expectancy of country populations with subjective features such as Life Ladder (1-10, how "satisfied" an individual is with their life), trust in government, and freedom. Analyzed the weights to identify Life Ladder, how satisfied one is with their life, correlates with lifespan. Tools used: Jupyter, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

<h3> Agents </h3>
Summary: Initialized a population of Agents with exchanging energy mechanisms to model the complexity of community interactions. Mastered key practices in object-oriented programming in Python.
